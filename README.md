# Forex Algorithmic Trading Bot

## Description
This project is an autonomous trading bot designed for the forex market. It integrates web scraping for real-time market data, backtests trading strategies using Python, and provides a user-friendly interface using React. The bot is capable of executing trades autonomously based on pre-defined strategies and can visualize key market insights and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for backtesting, trading logic, and web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Pandas).
- **React**: Frontend for data visualization and user interaction.
- **HTML & JavaScript**: Supporting the frontend.
- **Excel**: Exporting backtest results and data.
- **APIs/Web Scraping**: Collecting real-time forex data.
  
## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Collects forex market data using BeautifulSoup.
- **Backtesting**: Tests trading strategies using historical data.
- **Autonomous Trading**: Automatically executes trades based on strategies.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays market trends, technical indicators, and bot performance using React.
- **Real-Time Data Feed**: Shows live market data and headlines related to forex pairs.
- **Trading Bot**: Capable of running autonomously with minimal human intervention.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forex-trading-bot.git
cd forex-trading-bot
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed. Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup the Frontend (React)

Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and install the React dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

To start the React frontend, run:

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Run the Bot

You can run the bot by executing the main Python scripts in the `bot/` directory. Ensure that the web scraper and trader logic are correctly configured.

```bash
python bot/trader.py
```

The bot will start fetching real-time data, backtest strategies, and execute trades based on the logic you’ve implemented.

## Usage

Once the bot is up and running, it will:
- Scrape market data from forex sources.
- Backtest strategies against historical data.
- Provide visualizations through the frontend (React).
- Autonomously execute trades based on live market data.

You can view real-time updates and performance in the frontend, and export data to Excel for further analysis.

## Demo

Here’s a quick demo of the bot in action:

_(Include screenshots or a GIF demonstrating the bot’s functionality, frontend, or visualizations)_

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Strategy Implementation**: Add more sophisticated trading strategies.
- **Risk Management**: Integrate risk management features to minimize potential losses.
- **User Authentication**: Secure the frontend for multiple users with login functionality.
- **API Integration**: Enhance real-time data accuracy using third-party APIs (e.g., Forex API).
